Table views, Gantt charts, Kanban boards, custom fields, time tracking, smart scheduling — all stored as plain Markdown with YAML frontmatter. No external services. No sync subscriptions. Your data stays yours.

## What's inside

- **Plain-text data** — Projects and tasks live as `.md` files in your vault. Portable, searchable, version-controllable. No lock-in, ever.
- **Three powerful views** — Table, Gantt, and Kanban. Switch freely; same data, different lenses.
- **Real project management** — Not just checkboxes. Dependencies, milestones, subtasks, time tracking, recurring tasks, smart scheduling, bulk actions.
- **Customizable everything** — Custom fields, statuses, priorities, saved views — adapt the tool to your workflow, not the other way around.
- **Works offline** — No cloud, no API calls, no accounts. Just Obsidian.

## Views

### Table

Sortable, filterable task grid with inline editing. Save custom filter/sort combinations as named views. Quick-add tasks from the top bar. Select multiple tasks and apply bulk actions — change status, priority, assignee, or delete in one move.

### Gantt

Interactive timeline with draggable bars, resizable edges, and dependency arrows. Zoom from day to quarter. Drag to reschedule, resize to adjust duration. Milestones render as diamonds. A "today" line keeps you oriented.

### Kanban

Card-based board grouped by status. Drag cards between columns to update status instantly. Cards show priority, assignees, and tags at a glance.

## Features

### Task management
- **Subtasks** — Nest tasks to any depth. Collapse/expand hierarchies across all views.
- **Dependencies** — Link blocking/dependent tasks. Visualized as arrows on the Gantt chart.
- **Milestones** — Zero-duration tasks for key dates and deliverables.
- **Archive** — Archive completed tasks without deleting. Toggle visibility at any time.

### Scheduling & time
- **Drag-and-drop scheduling** — Reschedule tasks by dragging bars on the Gantt chart.
- **Smart scheduling** — Auto-adjust dependent task dates when a blocker's dates change. Cycle detection prevents circular dependencies.
- **Recurring tasks** — Daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly recurrence with configurable end dates.
- **Time estimates & logging** — Set estimated hours, log actual time with date and notes. Visual progress bar shows logged vs. estimated.
- **Due date notifications** — Get reminders before tasks are due. Configurable lead time.

### Customization
- **Custom fields** — Add per-project fields: text, number, date, select, multi-select, person, checkbox, URL.
- **Custom statuses & priorities** — Edit labels, colors, and icons for each status and priority level.
- **Saved views** — Save filter/sort combinations in Table view and switch between them instantly.
- **Team roster** — Manage a global team list for assignment across all projects, plus per-project team members.

### Bulk operations
- Multi-select tasks in Table view for batch actions:
  - Set status, priority, assignee, tag, or due date
  - Adjust progress
  - Archive/unarchive
  - Delete

### Import
- **Import existing notes** — Turn any Markdown file in your vault into a task. Choose to move or copy, set default status and priority, and batch-select files with search.

## Installation

### Via BRAT (beta releases)

1. Install the [BRAT plugin](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) from the community store.
2. Open BRAT settings > **Add Beta Plugin**.
3. Enter: `https://github.com/thismakesmehappy/obsidian-pm`
4. Enable the plugin in **Settings > Community plugins**.

### Manual

1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the [latest release](../../releases/latest).
2. Create a folder: `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/project-manager-fork/`
3. Copy the three files into that folder.
4. Reload Obsidian and enable the plugin under **Settings > Community plugins**.

## Fork release workflow

This fork keeps the upstream GitHub Actions release pipeline. For future BRAT-compatible releases, use:

1. Open **Actions** in `thismakesmehappy/obsidian-pm`.
2. Run **Bump Version**.
3. Enter a semver version such as `1.3.4` or `1.3.4-vault.1`.
4. The workflow will:
   - update `manifest.json`, `package.json`, and `versions.json`
   - create and push the Git tag
   - build the plugin
   - publish a GitHub release with `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css`

BRAT can then install or update directly from:

- `thismakesmehappy/obsidian-pm`

## Quick start

1. Click the dashboard icon in the ribbon (or run **Open projects pane** from the command palette).
2. Click **New project** to create your first project. Give it a name, color, and icon.
3. Open the project — it opens in Table view by default.
4. Press **+ Add task** to create your first task.
5. Switch views using the Table / Gantt / Kanban tabs at the top.

**Commands:**
- `Open projects pane`
- `Create new project`
- `Create new task`
- `Create new subtask`

## Data format

Everything is stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter in a configurable vault folder (default: `Projects/`). Plain text — readable, portable, and version-controllable.

```yaml

priority: high
due: "2026-04-01"

## Contributing

I appreciate community interest in the project! However, since this plugin is maintained by one person in their spare time, I have strict rules to keep the codebase clean, stable, and manageable. 

If you want to contribute, please follow these rules:

1. **Open an Issue first:** Do not submit a Pull Request for new features, architecture changes, or major refactoring without discussing it in an issue first. Uncoordinated PRs will be closed.
2. **No AI-generated bulk code:** I do not accept massive, AI-generated PRs. Code must be human-readable, minimalistic, and match the existing project style.
3. **Pass the CI:** Make sure your code passes all strict type checks, linters, and tests. Run `pnpm check`, `pnpm check:submission`, and `pnpm test` locally before pushing.
4. **Keep it small:** PRs should be strictly focused on a single issue. 

Bug fixes and thoroughly discussed features are always welcome!
